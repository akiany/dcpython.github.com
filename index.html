        M Street Washington, DC 20036). Talks range from core language features to 
        cutting-edge techniques in a hot web framework. Attending one of these monthly 
        meetings is the easiest way to get a sense of the group, and you are bound to 
        learn something! Or, even better, volunteer to present on some technology you 
        are passionate about and teach us something new.</p>

        <h1>Get Involved</h1>
        <p>Our most popular and frequent activity is our monthly user group meeting. On the first Tuesday of each month, we gather at Radio Free Asia (2025 M Street Washington, DC 20036) to catch up on what one another have been doing, and then to hear one or two prepared talks about some exciting aspect of Python technology. Talks range from core language features to cutting-edge techniques in a hot web framework. Attending one of these monthly meetings is the easiest way to get a sense of the group, and you are bound to learn something! Or, even better, volunteer to present on some technology you are passionate about and teach us something new.</p>
        <p>We also happily support sprints and tutorials on a regular basis. We've hosted a variety of sprints, trainings for Plone and Turbogears, and even an international conference. If you're interested in attending these sorts of activities, come to the meetings and join our mailing list; that's how we spread the word. Or, if you've got an open source project that could use a sprint or you're looking to teach the fine programmers of DC about your fantastic python library, get in touch with DC Python's board [Link to about the board and a board contact email] and we'll help you with space, resources, and to market your event.</p>
        <p>If you've had all the socializing you can take, or if you just have a corporate sponsorship budget burning a hole in your pocket, we also look to raise funds for both local events and for the larger organizations that keep Python's trains running. Again, get in touch with DC Python's board and we can help you figure out what sort of sponsorship can help keep your giving aligned with your goals.</p>
